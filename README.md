# Hypothetical Game Studio Website

Welcome to the official website of our fictional game studio! 
This is a **frontend-focused web development project** that showcases a complete multi-page, interactive, static site, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It simulates site of a modern game company.

**Note:** This is my **first major web development project**. It was created to apply and demonstrate what I've learned about structuring, designing, and adding interactivity to a complete website.

‚ö†Ô∏è This project does not include any backend or database integration ‚Äî all interactivity is handled client-side, and data like forum comments will reset on page refresh.
